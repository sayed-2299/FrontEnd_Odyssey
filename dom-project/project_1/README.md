## Overview
This project is my first learning task focused on practicing DOM manipulation. The assignment involved starting with a JSON file, converting it into a JavaScript object, and then dynamically generating webpage content using DOM concepts. This exercise provided hands-on experience in working with JSON data and dynamically updating the web page.
